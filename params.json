The data is computed to present the total amount of labeled carbons in each metabolite.  \r\nProteomics Time course of ethanol treated wild type.xls - Data from Soufi et al.[4] epresenting the fold change to time 0 of different protein products associated with the genes in the network.  \r\n\r\nThe Tutorial Contains three parts.  \r\nIn Part 1, we set up the network, which is necessary for image matching.  \r\nIn Part 2, we add images based on the data to the network.  \r\nIn Part 3, we will split the network into parts based on compartments and pathways.  \r\n\r\n## Part 1: Setting up the Network for IDARE in Cytoscape\r\nIn this example, we will set up the *E.Coli* core network for use with IDARE and add some additional annotations to the network.\r\n\r\n#### 1.1 Loading the E.Coli Core model\r\nAfter installing the IDARE app (either from the Cytoscape app store or from [here](http://idare.uni.lu/IDAREJars/IDARE.jar)), load the *E.coli* core network by selecting\r\nFile -> Import -> Network -> File and select the *E.Coli* core file you downloaded.\r\n\r\n#### 1.2 Generating an initial Layout\r\nFrom the Layout menu, select a layout you want to apply (for this tutorial we assume, that the **y-Files organic layout** was choosen, or no additional layout if you have cy3sbml installed).\r\n\r\n#### 1.3 Setting up the Network for IDARE\r\n\r\nRight click on some empty space in the network view.  \r\nSelect 'Apps' -> 'Setup Network For IDARE'  \r\nA popup will appear that lets you select the properties to be used in IDARE.  \r\nOn the left you can select the columns you want to use for the setup. On the right, depending on your choice of columns, you can select the values to be used for compound and interaction.  \r\nSelect the sbml type column as column to determine node types and the sbml id column as column to determine the node names.  \r\nAs compound node value select species, and as interaction node value select reaction.  \r\nCheck the 'Overwrite existing values' checkbox.  \r\nIf you are using cy3sbml please select the Base network view (it should have 187 nodes and 380 edges).\r\n\r\n#### 1.4 Changing to the IDARE Visual Style\r\nFrom the 'Style' tab in the 'Control Panel' select the 'IDARE Visual Style' and apply it to the network. Note, that the IDARE images cannot be removed from this style. If you want to use the images with another style, you can add and remove them by right-clicking in the display area, and select Apps->Add/Remove IDARE Images\r\n\r\n#### 1.5 Adding SBML Annotations and Gene Nodes\r\nRight click on some empty space in the network view.  \r\nSelect 'Apps' -> 'Add SBML Annotations'  \r\nSelect the *E.Coli* core network file again. If you have cy3sbml this step is not necessary, as IDARE will automatically use the SBML structure provided by cy3sbml for the network.  \r\nYou will be asked, whether you want to add Gene Nodes. Tick the box (if not done already) and click Ok.  \r\nYou will notice, that additional nodes have been created, which represent the protein and gene nodes that were created. Proteins are created for all conjunctive GPR clauses (i.e. all possible and combinations that fulfil a GPR).  \r\nIf the SBML contains enzyme species (annotated by the \"isEncodedBy\" bio qualifier), you would be asked which labeling pattern (i.e. database) to use for the genes and proteins.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Part2: Automated image generation and loading images to the Network.\r\nIn this example you will generate a few images based on artificial data and map it to the previously created and initialized network.\r\nThis example assumes that you have at loaded the E.coli core network and set up the network for IDARE (Steps 1 and 3 of the previous example).\r\n\r\n####Load Data into IDARE\r\nIn the 'Control Panel', select the IDARE tab.  \r\nClick on 'Add Dataset'  \r\nIn the dialog, click on 'Choose File'  \r\nSelect \"Fold Change of Gene Expression ethanol vs no ethanol.xls\" and click 'open'  \r\nThe 'DataSet Description' field will be updated with the file name  \r\nAs 'DataSet Type', select 'Array Dataset' (since this dataset contains only one sheet).  \r\nCheck the 'Use two column headers' option, as we only have one header.  \r\nClick ok.  \r\n\r\nRepeat the process with \"Proteomics Time course of ethanol treated wild type.xls\" and \"Total relative C13 label.xls\" which should both be loaded as 'Multiarray Dataset'.\r\nThe Proteomics time course only contains one sheet, so it can be added both as multiarray and array dataset. Adding it in both versions allows the selection of additional layouts (those specific to multiarray datasets and those specific to array datasets).  \r\nFinally repeat the process with \"Metabolomics fold change treatment vs Control.xls\" which should be loaded as 'Array Dataset'.  \r\nThe labeling data only has one column for its IDs, thus you should uncheck the box for two column headers.\r\nExample descriptions would be \"External Metabolite amount information\" and \"Reaction Activity during the experiment\" and \"Internal Metabolite Amounts at specific stages\".\r\n\r\n####2.2 Create the Visualisation\r\nYou can now select individual datasets you want to visualize. \r\nTo do so, choose a selection of datasets from the table by ticking the \"selected\" boxes.  \r\nIn the lower left corner, (below the 'Create' and 'Preview' buttons) are indicators, how many nodes the datasets represent in total and how many shared nodes the selection contains.  \r\nWhen creating visualisations for multiple datasets at once, there should be an overlap of the sets, otherwise parts of the generated image will always stay blank since no data is available.\r\nHowever, you can of course create multiple different nodes by selecting different sets of data.\r\nImages will only be created for nodes which are part of a selected dataset and old images will be kept unless a new image is created for the node.\r\n\r\n####2.3 Adding IDARE images to other Styles\r\nIf you did not select the IDARE visual style, but want to use a different style for your network, you can do so by right-clicking anywhere in a network view using the style you want to add your nodes to.\r\nSelect 'Apps' -> 'Add IDARE Images'. Now the images will be shown for your choosen style.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Part3: Subnetwork Generation\r\n\r\nThe first step of this this Example is independent on the first 2 Examples.\r\nFor the second step, it is necessary to have the SBML annotations added to the network (step 1.5), as otherwise the corresponding table column does not exist.\r\nYou can add the sbml annotation to the Cytosol network (C_c) after step 1 of this example, but this would lead to gene nodes not being added in the external compartment subnetwork.\r\n\r\n####3.1 Create Networks for the External compartment and the cytosol\r\nWe first want to split the network at the transporters which translocate metabolites from the external compartment to the cytosol, and vice versa.  \r\nTo do so:  \r\nSelect 'Apps' -> 'IDARE' -> 'Create Subnetworks'  \r\nor  \r\nRight Click in an empty space in the network you want to create subnetworks in -> 'Apps' -> 'Create Subnetworks'  \r\nIn the resulting dialog, you can select the column to determine the node types as well as the node names.  \r\nIf the network is set up for IDARE (see Part 1), appropriate columns are chosen automatically (i.e. if you have set up the network for idare - Step 1.3 - you can just accept the selection) .  \r\nYou further have to choose a value for nodes which form the branching points between subnetworks, and a value for nodes that form the \"base\" of the subnetwork.\r\nSince the aim is to branch at the transporters between compartments reactions will be used as branching nodes and species as subnetwork nodes.   \r\nClick accept, when you finished your selection.  \r\nIn the next dialog, you can select the column that contains the subnetwork identifiers as well as the type of layout that should be used for the subnetwork (or the \"keep layout\" option, if the current layout shoudl be kept)\r\nThe table allows you to select nodes, which should not branch and those which should be removed entirely  (e.g. nodes with too many connections).   \r\nDepending on the network size some nodes are already suggested by the tool.  \r\nSince we want to create the networks for the cytosol and external compartment, we select \"sbml compartment\" as column to determine sub-networks.  \r\nWe leave the 'Keep Layout' option as it is and select remove for the Biomass reaction (as this reaction mainly leads to a hairball structure).  \r\nWe also select C\\_c, the cytosol, and C\\_e, the external medium, in the sub-networks to be generated table.   \r\nIf we now click on the \"network\" tab in the 'Control Panel' we will see two new networks that were generated.   \r\n\r\n####3.2 Create pathway networks in the Cytosol\r\nThere is not much to see in the external compartment, as it only contains the transporters and the cytosol is still a hairball. \r\nTo get a better overview, we would like to generate pathway networks in the cytosol.  \r\nTo do so, again, select 'Apps' -> 'SubNetworkGenerator'  \r\nHowever, this time, since reactions belong to pathways and metabolites can be shared between different pathways, we select species as values for branching nodes and reaction as value for subnetwork nodes.  \r\nBy default, the \"COBRA_SUBSYSTEM\" column generated by the SBMLAnnotator is selected, if available, so this selection is already fine.  \r\nFrom the metabolites we would like to exclude currency metabolites and most cofactors.  \r\nFor larger networks, the pre-selection is better, but on small networks (like the e.coli core), the relative amounts of presence tend to be higher, so we have to select additional nodes to remove during the generation process.  \r\nSelect M\\_h\\_c, M\\_h2o\\_c, M\\_atp\\_c, M\\_pi\\_c, M\\_pi\\_c, M\\_nadh\\_c, M\\_nad\\_c, M\\_adp\\_c, M\\_nadph\\_c, M\\_co2\\_c, M\\_nadp\\_c and M\\_coa\\_c, as metabolites to remove.  \r\n\r\nAs pathways, we would like to create 'Glycolysis', the 'Citric Acid Cycle', 'Glyoxylate Shunt' and the 'Pentose phosphate pathway'.  \r\nClick ok.  \r\n\r\nYou can now navigate through the different pathways. If you wish to create additional pathways, select the source network again and repeat the steps.\r\nNew links will be added to the existing networks.\r\n\r\nYou will notice, that links from parental networks will be included in the newly created networks, but no links are generated in these parental networks. \r\nIn general, links will be generated for all networks built on the same column, that share linking nodes. \r\nIf you create additional subnetworks at a later stage, links to and from old networks will be created for all newly generated networks.\r\n\r\nYou can see, that the labelling for ketoglutarate is much smaller than the labelling of any other measured metabolite. One potential reason is an increase in the glyoxylate shunt (visible in both the proteomics and gene expression of the enzymes involved in that pathway). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n##Citations\r\n[1]Horinouchi T, Tamaoka K, Furusawa C, Ono N, Suzuki S, Hirasawa T, Yomo T, Shimizu H (2010) Transcriptome analysis of parallel-evolved escherichia coli strains under ethanol stress.
